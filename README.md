# Simulation_Modeling
Simulations and Modeling projects for decision making (mostly for CS166). 
I recommend looking at these following projects:

1. [LGA Taxi Simulation - report](https://github.com/tomereldor/Simulation_Modeling/blob/master/CS166%20Final%20%E2%80%93%20LGA%20Taxi%20Simulation%20-%20Tomer.pdf) and [code](https://github.com/tomereldor/Simulation_Modeling/blob/master/CS166%20Final%20%E2%80%93%20LGA%20Taxi%20Simulation.ipynb) â€“ simulation of various strategies for taxi queues bottleneck at LGa airport, reporting best results

2. [Social Dynamics Simulation, according to Social Judgement theory and Miscommunication](https://github.com/tomereldor/Simulation_Modeling/blob/master/Social%20Dynamics%20Simulation%20Final.pdf)
